                <p> 
                    Journals allow people to not only vent out certain frustrations, but also allow them to reflect and truly find what might've caused the root of their stress.

                <h6> Seek Out A Close Friend </h6> 
                <p> 
                    Often times, we look to friends or companions to help us during rough patches. Seeking out a trusted friend that you can vent to about your problems 
                    is always a welcome solution. And in some cases the friend in question can bring some much needed light or enlightment to an issue that helps you potentially solve whatever
                    stresses you. Its also important to open as it allows you build strong bonds with those around you. While it is understandable that some may not be as truthworthy or you are scared to do so, 
                    its important to reach out when need be. Remember, you're never alone^^

                <h6> Do some physical ativity, gym, walking, etc</h6> 
                <p> 
                    Sometimes, people don't want to think, and its better to perform self improvement. Going to the gym or walking with music is a great way to just get out there 
                    and let out some of that stress quietly while also providing you with a way to improve yourself. It is also good to reflect and think when all taht is on your mind is lifting, walking or stretching. 
                    Giving you the perfect outlet to have a conversation with yourself or face mental issues that hurt you.
